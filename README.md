##CSE 332 Lab 0: Ranks, Suits, Cards and Files

###Development environment
- Macbook Pro
- Clion

###TODO
- read in and parse command line arguments
- open a file and read in strings from it
- parse those strings as the definitions of cards in a standard playing deck for bridge, cribbage, poker, etc
- print out what was read and parsed from the file so you can check easily that it worked correctly.
